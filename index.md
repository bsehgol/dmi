# Welcome to Designing Meaningful Interactions by Katherine Dillon

You can view [Week 1 assignment](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vgpuJA4gBx7ddJbG7qAa_ueDPiDff4OaIl3Gv5FYZaU/edit#slide=id.p) to get an overview of the issue we discussed in class. 

During the next six weeks we will study:

1. What is UX
2. Discover - a problem
3. Define - ideation, applying it to a problem
4. Design UX
5. Design UI - visual layer on the top, color, typogoraphy, white space usage 
6. Develop and Test - user testing


### 5 characteristics of good UX:
```markdown
Intuitive - without instructional manual
Efficient - worth pepoles time,
Memorable
Anticipates errors
Satisfying - so people want to come back
```

#### A lot of ux designers call themselves product designers.
#### Product shouldnâ€™t come with a manual with instructions it should be intuitive. 
#### Focus on the user and all else will follow 
#### Desirable experience = good business
